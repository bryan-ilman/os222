## Week 01

## Week 02
1. [How does SSH work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4)<br>

2. [The basics of checksum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFOGDY2e0mQ)<br>
In the video, Eddie Woo really manages to help me understand just enough about checksum that I now feel comfortable using it in my program. He only used simple words and that is just brilliant.

4. [First step into bash scripting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bash-scripting-introduction-to-bash-and-bash-scripting/)<br>
Bash scripting is really something useful to execute lines of instructions just using the command lines. If you want to truly master Linux, this is an important skill you need to acquire.
